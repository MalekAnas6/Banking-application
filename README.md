# OOP Team Project – Banking Application (Concept)

This project is a **conceptual banking system application** created as part of a university course on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## 🚀 Purpose

The application is **not meant to represent a real-world secure or scalable banking system**. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating:

- Object-Oriented Programming principles (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction)
- Basic data handling
- Event-driven programming using Windows Forms in C#
- GUI design logic in a desktop application

## 💡 Disclaimer

> 🔹 Some logic and behaviors within the system **may not make sense** from a real-world perspective. This is intentional, as the goal was to **apply and demonstrate OOP concepts** rather than build a production-ready app.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET Framework
- **UI:** Windows Forms (WinForms)

> Note: WinForms is considered **an older UI technology**, but was used here for simplicity and to focus on programming fundamentals.

## 📁 Features

- Account creation with card info
- Simple validation (not security-focused)
- Basic file-based data saving
- No database or encryption

## 👥 Authors

- Developed by a team of students as part of a university OOP course in 2024.

**⚠️ Do not use this application for real banking scenarios or sensitive data storage. It is strictly educational.**
